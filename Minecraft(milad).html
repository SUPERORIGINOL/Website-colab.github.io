        <p>"Minecraft" is a sandbox video game that allows players to explore, create, and survive in a blocky 3D world. The game has various modes such as survival, creative, and adventure. In survival mode, players must gather resources, craft tools, and protect themselves from hostile creatures like zombies, skeletons, and Creepers. The goal is to survive, explore, and create while avoiding dangers like falling into lava or being overwhelmed by mobs.</p>

        <p class="h4">
            Surviving and thriving in Minecraft requires a mix of strategy, resourcefulness, and combat skills. Here are some key survival strategies that will help you master the game:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Gather Resources Early</strong>
                <p>Start by gathering wood, stone, and food sources. Collect wood to craft basic tools like axes and pickaxes, and gather stone to upgrade your tools. Ensure you have enough food to sustain yourself, such as bread, meat, or fruits.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Craft Essential Tools First</strong>
                <p>Craft a wooden pickaxe, axe, and shovel early on. These tools will help you mine resources, cut down trees, and clear land quickly. Upgrade to stone tools as soon as possible for better durability and efficiency.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Build a Shelter</strong>
                <p>Before nightfall, build a shelter to protect yourself from hostile mobs. You can dig into the side of a mountain or create a simple house out of wood or stone. Ensure your shelter is secure and has a crafting table, furnace, and chests for storage.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Upgrade Weapons and Armor</strong>
                <p>As soon as you have enough resources, craft armor and weapons. Start with leather or iron armor for protection and an iron sword or bow to defend yourself. Upgrade to diamond or netherite armor for maximum defense against tougher enemies.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Manage Hunger and Health</strong>
                <p>Keep an eye on your hunger bar, as a full bar will allow you to regenerate health. Gather food like wheat, potatoes, and meat from animals. Cooking food in a furnace will restore more health than eating raw food.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Defend Against Mobs</strong>
                <p>During the night or in dark areas, hostile mobs like zombies, skeletons, and Creepers will spawn. Defend your shelter by lighting up the area with torches or using walls and fences to keep mobs at bay. Ranged weapons like bows and arrows are useful for defending from a distance.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Explore and Mine for Resources</strong>
                <p>Explore the world to find valuable resources like iron, gold, and diamonds. Dig deep into caves or mine down to find ores. Be cautious when mining, as you may encounter lava or hostile mobs like cave spiders and skeletons.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Enchant and Upgrade Gear</strong>
                <p>Use an enchantment table to enchant your armor and weapons for better durability and effects. Enchanting gear will give you additional abilities, such as increased damage or protection against certain types of damage.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Farm and Breed Animals</strong>
                <p>Farm crops like wheat, carrots, and potatoes for sustainable food sources. Breed animals like cows, pigs, and chickens for meat, leather, and other resources. Set up a breeding area for each type of animal to maintain a steady supply of resources.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Explore The Nether</strong>
                <p>The Nether is a dangerous dimension with unique resources like Nether quartz, blaze rods, and soul sand. To enter the Nether, build a portal with obsidian and light it with flint and steel. Be prepared for tough mobs like ghasts, blazes, and magma cubes.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prepare for the End</strong>
                <p>The End is the final dimension where the Ender Dragon resides. To access it, find a stronghold and use Ender Pearls and Blaze Powder to activate the portal. Be ready with the best gear, including enchanted armor, weapons, and plenty of healing items.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Time Management and Building Projects</strong>
                <p>Manage your time wisely by balancing resource gathering, exploration, and building. Minecraft is a game of endless possibilities, so use your free time to create impressive structures, farms, and contraptions. Whether you’re building a castle or a redstone machine, plan ahead to maximize efficiency.</p>
            </li>
